`When you hit a setback, start by considering what your thoughts are.

Ask yourself, "What is the story Iâ€™m telling myself about this situation? What judgments have I made about this setback?"

For example, if you you've just eating a pint of ice cream due to stress, you may think "I just ruined all my hard work. I'll never get back on track."`

`Next, it's time for a reality check.

Pretend you're a friend. Ask yourself, "Are there facts to back up my thought? If a friend shared this thought, what would I say to them? How would I help them get back on track?"

For example, "Is it true that I ruined all my hard work? Is giving up the only thing I can do?"`

`Now respond to your reality check with a new helpful thought based on your reality check.

For example, "Yes, I ate that ice cream without planning to. However, that doesn't discount all the progress I've made. It's just one moment and I can get back on track with my goals."

Or, "We all have times like thatâ€”it happens. Don't beat yourself up. You have what it takes to get back on track."`

`Finally, commit to the action you want to take, instead of the one that an unhelpful thought might lead you to.

For example, now that you've addressed your negative thoughts, you can take steps towards your goals.`
