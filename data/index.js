`On Monday, if you eat a banana you can feel proud of yourself. This makes you more likely to do the same in the future.

When you do the same on Thursday, you're further reinforcing the behaviour. This creates the fuel you need to advance further with your goal.

Once you're comfortable with once every three days, you can go to once every two days, and once you're ready, you can completely replace your snack with bananas. 

All because you reinforced your behaviour by accomplishing achievable goals.`

`1. Set specific goals. The more specific, the better. For example, "I will go for a walk at 5:30 a.m. after brushing my teeth."

This works because it gets you thinking about HOW you'll achieve a goal. You're much more likely to go for a walk when you've decided where and when you'll do it.`

        title: 'A framework for setting effective goals',

      {
        title: 'A framework for setting effective goals',
        content:
`2. Set truly achievable goals. For example, rather than trying to quit something cold-turkey, start by removing it from your life once a week.

Once you're comfortable with once, a week, you can try twice a week. Again, this approach makes your more likely to achieve your desired behaviour because you're reinforcing it through constant accomplishment.`

      {
        title: 'A framework for setting effective goals',

`Ultimately, it is better to set behaviour-based goals because achieving these goals is entirely in your control.

For example, there are many things that can affect the amount of weight you hold. Humidity, water intake, sodium levels, time since eating, etc.

So in the short-term, it's very difficult to control the amount of weight lost, which can lead to frustration and disappointment.`

        title: 'A framework for setting effective goals',

`On the other hand, studies have shown that setting behavioural goals actually leads to greater likelihood of achieving desired outcomes.

This is because it is changes in behaviours that drive changes in outcomes.

So when we focus on changing our behaviours by setting achievable, behaviour-based goals, we make the fastest progress towards achieving desired outcomes.`

If this series of events happens enough times, a habit is formed.`

        title: 'Transform your behaviours into habits',
        content:
`This is good for us because it means that as we stay consistent on our short-term, achievable goals, the behaviours associated with these goals will eventually become habitual.

Unfortunately, scientific evidence indicates that there is no set number of times a behaviour has to be repeated to become habit. But as you stay consistent on your short-term, achievable goals, it will gradually become easier to perform these behaviours until they become habitual.`

`2. Identify a cue of the behaviour. What indicator tells you that it's time to perform a behaviour?

This could be seeing that it's a certain time of day or being in a certain setting. 

It's even better to be more specific. For example, when you enter the kitchen, you drink a glass of water.`

      {
        title: 'Breaking bad habits',

`Because cues lead to behaviours, it's necessary to break the cue-behaviour link between your undesired behaviour and its cue.

For example, if your cue to eat a bowl of ice cream is coming home from a hot day at school, you can disrupt the link by eating some fruit instead.

This is powerful because it leverages an existing link to propogate a positive behaviour.`
