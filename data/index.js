This is because of the principle of positive reinforcement, which states that rewarding behaviours are more likely to be repeated.`

        title: 'The power of achievable goals',
        content:
`As you accomplish small goals in quick succession, the proudness you feel with each accomplishment makes you more likely to repeat the behaviour.

For instance, if your goal is to replace your usual snack with a banana each day, you can start by replacing the snack once every three days.`

`On Monday, if you eat a banana you can feel proud of yourself. This makes you more likely to do the same in the future.

When you do the same on Thursday, you're further reinforcing the behaviour. This creates the fuel you need to advance further with your goal.

Once you're comfortable with once every three days, you can go to once every two days, and once you're ready, you can completely replace your snack with bananas. 

All because you reinforced your behaviour by accomplishing achievable goals.`

`1. Set specific goals. The more specific, the better. For example, "I will go for a walk at 5:30 a.m. after brushing my teeth."

This works because it gets you thinking about HOW you'll achieve a goal. You're much more likely to go for a walk when you've decided where and when you'll do it.`

      {
        title: 'A framework for setting effective goals',

`With a specific goal, you'll know exactly when you've achieved it.

This results in easier reinforcement of behaviour - because you can feel proud of yourself at the specific point that you've achieved a specific goal.`

      {
        title: 'A framework for setting effective goals',
        content:
`2. Set truly achievable goals. For example, rather than trying to quit something cold-turkey, start by removing it from your life once a week.

Once you're comfortable with once, a week, you can try twice a week. Again, this approach makes your more likely to achieve your desired behaviour because you're reinforcing it through constant accomplishment.`

        title: 'A framework for setting effective goals',

`3. Make your goals behaviour-based rather than outcome-based

A behaviour based goal may be, "I will eat between 2,000 and 2,200 calories each day", while an outcome-based goal would be "I will lose 1 pound this week."`
      },
      {
        title: 'A framework for setting effective goals',
        content:
`Ultimately, it is better to set behaviour-based goals because achieving these goals is entirely in your control.

For example, there are many things that can affect the amount of weight you hold. Humidity, water intake, sodium levels, time since eating, etc.

So in the short-term, it's very difficult to control the amount of weight lost, which can lead to frustration and disappointment.`
      },
      {
        title: 'A framework for setting effective goals',
        content:
`On the other hand, studies have shown that setting behavioural goals actually leads to greater likelihood of achieving desired outcomes.

This is because it is changes in behaviours that drive changes in outcomes.

So when we focus on changing our behaviours by setting achievable, behaviour-based goals, we make the fastest progress towards achieving desired outcomes.`

`Habits are powerful because they're automatic. 

A habit is formed when a specfic cue leads to a behaviour which is quickly followed by a positive impact.

If this series of events happens enough times, a habit is formed.`

      {
        title: 'Transform your behaviours into habits',
        content:
`This is good for us because it means that as we stay consistent on our short-term, achievable goals, the behaviours associated with these goals will eventually become habitual.

Unfortunately, scientific evidence indicates that there is no set number of times a behaviour has to be repeated to become habit. But as you stay consistent on your short-term, achievable goals, it will gradually become easier to perform these behaviours until they become habitual.`

`2. Identify a cue of the behaviour. What indicator tells you that it's time to perform a behaviour?

This could be seeing that it's a certain time of day or being in a certain setting. 

It's even better to be more specific. For example, when you enter the kitchen, you drink a glass of water.`

This could mean making the behaviour enjoyable (e.g. listening to music while doing the behaviour), or getting a rewarding result as an outcome of the behaviour (e.g. a sense of accomplishment)`
