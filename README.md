# AI-Powered, Education-Focused, Text-Based App for Gamers to Lose Weight

My first mobile app - built with React Native, Expo, NativeWind, Gemini.

## Inspiration
Obesity is on the rise - so are the number of people trying but failing to lose weight. What we're missing is a comprehensive resource that provides real, practical education on self-improvement in terms of weight loss.

## What it does
Delivers science-based, bite-sized lessons in the form of text conversations with an AI coach. Also features a gamified habit tracker system.

## What's next
1. Research and develop lessons
2. Personalized advice from the AI coach based on recorded behaviour
3. Integration with other platforms via the cloud
